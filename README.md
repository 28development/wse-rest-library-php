# PHP REST Library
A php library that wraps the Wowza REST API.

## Prerequisites
Wowza Streaming Engine 4.0.0 or later is required.

## Usage
Several examples of usage within the tests folder. To setup the library to point to your server, you can modify the include/constants.php file and modify the following lines:

```PHP
define("BASE_DIR", dirname(dirname(__FILE__)));
define("WOWZA_HOST","http://localhost:8087/v2");
define("WOWZA_SERVER_INSTANCE", "_defaultServer_");
define("WOWZA_VHOST_INSTANCE", "_defaultVHost_");
define("WOWZA_USERNAME", "admin");
define("WOWZA_PASSWORD", "admin");
```
